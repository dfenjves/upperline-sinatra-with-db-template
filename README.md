# Upperline Sinatra Template with Basic ActiveRecord Integration

This template provides a boilerplate Sinatra MVC application that can be used for reference or to fork/clone and build simple applications. In this version, we've added in ActiveRecord as an ORM to connect to SQL databases (we're using sqlite3 here). There is currently one migration, and one model (Item).
